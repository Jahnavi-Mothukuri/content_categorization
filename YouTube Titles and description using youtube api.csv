dntQi5oRuBc,Take Me to Nagaland | Web Series | TRAILER | North East India Travel Video | Tanya Khanijow,"WEB SERIES: Take Me To Nagaland 
Here's an ode to the beautiful state of Nagaland as we discover a little something about the culture, the tribes, the upcoming fashion designers, the pop culture and the FOOD (very important) of the North East Indian state of Nagaland! 

Accompanying me on this journey is Larissa Dsa, who has an impeccable style and spirit of adventure, and hence we will together discover the fashion and food secrets of Nagaland. Besides a perfect co-traveller, she is also a brilliant YouTuber and Photographer herself. You absolutely can't miss her work! :)

A second perfect addition to this trip is Namrata Menon, a very talented videographer/cinematographer. She and her work for me were and instant love and I can't recommend her enough for more video projects. Not only is she a talented girl, but also super fun to travel with. 

Our trio survived a 15 day worth of madness and exciting travel adventure and I cannot wait to share the whole series with you. The web series releases on 15th June, and is very different from my other travel series thus far. Stay tuned and hope this Trailer excites you!

t40hlvzEvwY,Can SpaceX Make Point-To-Point Space Travel Profitable?,"SpaceX and Blue Origin think point-to-point space travel will replace flights as the preferred means of passenger travel. A plane ride from New York City to Shanghai is about 15 hours - and it could be as long as 29 hours with connecting flights. With point-to-point travel, SpaceX says it could get you there in less than an hour. How realistic is this approach to long-haul travel?

As companies like Richard Branson‚Äôs Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos‚Äô Blue Origin close in on offering trips to the edge of space, space tourism is becoming a possibility. But what if spaceships went farther ‚Äî and faster?

Point-to-point space travel has been touted as a business line by SpaceX, Elon Musk‚Äôs rocket and spacecraft company.

AD8vRDaJWPs,NAGALAND - DZUKOU VALLEY &amp; JAKHAMA  | Travelling in North-East India | Indian Travel vlogs,"Welcome To Nagaland! (3/3) DZUKOU VALLEY & JAKHAMA - The villages in Nagaland.

I visited Nagaland in the month of April and had the opportunity to open my mind to endless experiences! For the longest time, Nagaland and the whole of North East has been so neglected: tourism wise and also culturally :(. So I took the plunge to discover the beautiful state myself, with two other creators- Tanya Khanijow & Namrata Menon. These girls have been the most lovely to travel with :)
This is Part 2 of the Nagaland series #TakeMeToNagaland! there are 3 in total! please watch part 1 because it's super fun and features the cities - Dimapur & Kohima ( the capital of Nagaland)


üôèüôèThings to remember when you plan your travel:üôèüôè

üôèThe Visvema route (the one I took) is much easier compared to the Jakhama route. 

üôèYou can camp  the previous night at Campsite Yedika just like I did, before you trek to the valley.

üôèDrones are not allowed in the valley (we had special permissions to use them)

üôèYou can get in touch with @tirelessfoot_nicholas on Instagram, incase you're interested to trek to the valley. He's a good buddy, and will help you in the best way

üôèEntry to the valley is INR 20/- only

üôèCarry your sleeping bags and down jackets cuz it's super windy and extremely cold at night. I went in the month of April and it was super cold.

üôèThe best option would be to trek early in the morning and reach the dormitory by or before 2pm. 

üôèDO NOT trek to Dzukou without a local guide.


üôèYou need an ILP-(Inner Line Permit) to enter the state of Nagaland. You can apply here‚Äî  https://www.india.gov.in/application-... 

üôèCommute in the city is pretty straightforward. You can use the local rickshaws, or hire a car to go around. The roads are super bumpy especially in Dimapur & Kohima, so be prepared :D

üôèThe food scene is very much different than mainland. Vegetarians options are available, but make sure you mention you‚Äôre vegetarian since they also tend to cook their veggies in pork fat. Nagaland thrives on pork and beef, and a lot of things you don‚Äôt see in the rest of the country. I suggest that you visit with an open mind, else it will be super difficult to survive. I personally loved the food. :D

üôèMake sure you have enough cash on you. It‚Äôs advisable to carry cash from home since it was even hard to find ATMs. 

üôèHomestays are the best way to experience the local living. Since the people are super friendly, the hosts are lovely to interact with and know so many things about the Naga culture.

üôèDo a lot of research before you visit. The state has 16 different tribes and they speak different dialects. Read about their lifestyle and food. 

üôèCarry your rainwear and warm clothes since the weather is pretty unpredictable. The best time to travel according to me is December (for Hornbill festival ) and also April. 

üôèNagaland is a dry state! :P 

üôèNagaland is a state full of beauty and the nicest people I've ever come across. The misconceptions about this magic land are hilarious! So do not believe anything else you hear about this place. We stayed here for 10 days and had no issues, problems at all! Trust me! Your next travel, must be planned for the north-east especially NAGALANDDD! 


üíãAlso, thanks to Tanya and Namrata, for helping me film so many shots! 

This video, and the rest of the videos of the Nagaland series are in collaboration with Tanya Khanijow! and also in collaboration with the super talented cinematographer - Namrata Menon :* Love you my mungi :*

JRaakIL-N_s,Fiji Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Fiji.d6023598.Destination-Travel-Guides

The locals in Fiji have a saying, ‚ÄúBulla,‚Äù which means ‚Äúlife‚Äù and ‚Äúgood health.‚Äù You‚Äôll hear it used frequently as a greeting when you arrive at the 330-strong islands that comprise this archipelago. You may even find yourself saying it before long!

Any Fiji tour will highlight its magnificent, unspoiled waters and lush landscapes. Go snorkeling, swimming, diving, and sailing on turquoise waters. If you‚Äôd rather stay on dry land, you can zipline through rainforests or explore the windy plains of the highland area. Travel to the interior and learn about traditional Fijian culture, or visit the capital city of Suva and wander through its colonial buildings, bazaars, and the quiet harbor. 

Two-thirds of the Fijian archipelago are uninhabited, and your Fiji sightseeing should include a stop at Denarau‚Äôs marina, where you can book a boat to take you to some of these pristine locations. From family-friendly islands to romantic getaways, you‚Äôll find something to your taste amongst these scattered isles.

R7vmHGAshi8,How to travel the world with almost no money | Tomislav Perko | TEDxTUHH,"Many people daydream about traveling the world, but all of them have the same excuse - lack of money. Tomislav, after traveling the world for years with almost no money, shows how it is possible for everyone to do the same, if they really want to.

Tomislav Perko, 29, is a travel writer from Croatia. After a career of a stockbroker, broke because of the financial crisis, he hits the road and turns it into his home. He uses alternative ways of traveling ‚Äì hitchhiking, couchsurfing, working/volunteering, and manages to wander around the world with just a little bit of money in his pocket, meeting the most amazing people on the way.

Five years later, he publishes a book ‚Äú1000 Days of Spring‚Äù and goes around giving lectures about what it means to live on the road. Find out more on his website: http://tomislavperko.com/en/.

This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx",travel

N4ZMYokojGw,Cuba Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia (4K),"https://www.expedia.com/explore/caribbean/cuba.d44

It‚Äôs only 93 miles from Florida, and just 13 from the Bahamas, but like the smoke that coils from its legendary cigars, The Republic of Cuba exists in a time and space all its own.
 
Few cities can stir the imagination like Cuba‚Äôs capital, Havana, a city preserved by forts, a five-mile seawall, and an imposed embargo, which held back the excesses of the 20th century for over 50 years.
  
Havana‚Äôs lure can be hard to resist, but Cuba offers so much more beyond the seductive lights of its capital. In Cuba, a long sandy beach is never far away. 
 
Just 12 miles from Havana‚Äôs downtown, the Eastern Beaches unroll toward the town of Matanzas, the birthplace of the rumba, and C√°rdenas, where the Cuban Flag flew for the very first time. From here, follow the scent of fresh lime, rum and suntan lotion north to Varadero. 
 
After exploring the northern coastline, turn south towards Cuba‚Äôs most revolutionary city, Santa Clara, and Trinidad, once the sugar capital of the world. Don‚Äôt miss elegant Cienfuegos, the only Cuban city founded by the French. 
 
Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to know whether Cuba is awakening to the world, or if the world is awakening to Cuba. Whatever your politics, it's easy to admire this island nation that has proudly gone its own way.
 
Cuba may still have one foot firmly in the past, but as the world tumbles towards tomorrow, we can be thankful for the many things it has not let go.",travel

vzSHcyXfNPw,Iceland Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"With a population of only 300,000, Iceland can feel like the most isolated place on earth, yet its capital Reykjavik, is only a three-hour flight from London and just under six from New York.
 
Reykjavik is relaxed and welcoming, yet possesses a cultural life that holds its own against other European capitals. Most buildings are built simple and low to beat the North Atlantic winds. However, the city is also graced with grand civic architecture inspired by Iceland‚Äôs natural beauty, such as the soaring central tower of Hallgr√≠mskirkja.
 
Many of the country‚Äôs most popular sights are within easy reach of Reykjav√≠k. Immerse yourself in the spirit of Iceland, at the Blue Lagoon. Then spend a day or two in The Golden Circle, an area which encompasses three of Iceland‚Äôs greatest natural wonders; Thingvellir National Park, the Geysir Geothermal Field, and Gullfoss.
 
Iceland‚Äôs main ring road strings together an endless series of epic landscapes. Less than two hours drive east of Reykjavik are two of the world‚Äôs most beautiful waterfalls, Seljalandsfoss and Sk√≥gafoss. Continue eastward towards V√≠k, Iceland‚Äôs southern-most village, where you‚Äôll find the dramatic landscapes of Black Beach, Reynisdrangar, and Dyrholaey. Follow the ring road for another two hours into the ethereal light of J√∂kuls√°rl√≥n Lake, where icebergs break away from Europe‚Äôs largest glacier and float for years before tumbling out to sea.
 
Head north and feel the earth rumble at Europe‚Äôs mightiest waterfall, Dettifoss. Then explore the Myvatn region, a tranquil lake surrounded by nature in all its violent beauty. Take a careful walk through the boiling landscape of Namafjall, lose yourself amid the lava pillars of Dimmuborgir, and peer into the caldera of Krafla Volcano.
 
Known as the Capital of the North, Akureyri is the perfect place to warm up and enjoy some creature comforts, before heading off into the wilds again. In Iceland, every side road is a story waiting to unfold. So come, and live your own Icelandic story, it‚Äôs one you‚Äôll keep telling for the rest of your days.

We also paid a visit to the many dentists of Mumbai! Rob broke one of his teeth on the train to Mumbai so we went looking for a reputable dentist in Mumbai. We‚Äôve heard that getting dental work done in India is actually something foreigners pay to do since it is a lot cheaper than a lot of countries and also of very high quality. So really, we are in the best possible place to fix Rob's teeth!

73ulvWgcZKA,Should My Boyfriend and I Travel Alone? // Ask Pastor John,"Is it wise for a girlfriend and boyfriend to travel together and stay in the same hotel? Should they? Pastor John gives three reasons why they shouldn‚Äôt.

Is it wise for a girlfriend and boyfriend to travel together? Stay in the same hotel? Should they? It‚Äôs a question we get regularly. And this time from a young woman. ‚ÄúHello, Pastor John. My boyfriend and I plan to leave in three weeks for a trip we scheduled five months ago. My mother said she fears for us and for the temptations that could arise during the trip. I have assured her that while we have fallen into temptation in the past, we have desperately sought God and other Christian counsel to confront that pattern, and that we truly have laid it at the foot of the cross. After discussing this respectfully and in full, we concluded that all would be fine.

‚ÄúToday my mother again confronted me and tells me that she believes we are dishonoring God, even though we will be staying in separate rooms the entire week. While I am frustrated, I also do not want to dishonor my parents‚Äô wishes. I‚Äôm troubled in wondering if we are dishonoring God by traveling together before marriage.‚Äù

7. NEKO
Thanks to her exceptionally well-hidden grave on the Greek island of Sikinos, a noblewoman named Neko and her precious gold jewelry remained undiscovered for 1,800 years. Greek archaeologists discovered Neko‚Äôs grave in 2018. Grave robbers didn‚Äôt miss out on her treasures for a lack of trying - in fact, they hit various other tombs on Sikinos, which is part of the Cyclades archipelago. 

6. MAGNETIC STATUES
In a park within a small town called La Democracia, which is located near the Pacific Guatemalan coast, there‚Äôs a series of 11 ancient stone ‚Äúpotbelly‚Äù sculptures on display. Surprisingly, these sculptures are magnetized on certain parts, indicating that the pre-Columbian civilization that crafted them may have had a knowledge of magnetism.

5. SANDBY BORG
Around 1,600 years ago, a gruesome fight occurred at a fort called Sandby Borg on Sweden‚Äôs √ñland Island. Hundreds of people were killed in the attack and left unburied. After the attack, the site was left alone by neighbors, leading researchers to believe that it was considered a taboo place.

4. Panga ya Saidi
The 1,076-square-foot main chamber of the Panga Ya Saidi cave network in Kenya‚Äôs Rift Valley bears evidence of 78,000 continuous years of human occupation. Let that sink in for a minute! It sits where grassland meets with coastal tropical forest, thus providing its former inhabitants with the convenient ability to exploit resources from both environments. 

3. THOUSANDS OF TEETH
On two separate occasions in 2018, batches of over 1,000 teeth were discovered in different parts of the world. Last year, archaeologists conducting a preliminary excavation at the site of a future subway station began uncovering teeth. They ultimately collected over 1,000 teeth, which were estimated to be around a century old.

2. ATA
In 2003, someone discovered a naturally-mummified, six-inch-tall skeleton near a ghost town in the Chilean Atacama Desert. The skeleton was female and had unusually hard bones for her size, as well as a conical-shaped head. Rumors quickly spread that the skeleton was that of an alien. In 2012, a doctor named Steven Greer analyzed the skeleton, who was named Ata, using x-ray and CT imaging. 

1. A RARE PAINTING OF JESUS
Earlier this year, archaeologists from the University of Haifa announced the discovery of a rare early painting of Jesus inside an ancient church in the Israeli village of Shivta. The 1,500-year-old depiction of Jesus looks quite different from the popular Western image of him. It was found in the Negev Desert of southern Israel among the ruins of a Byzantine-era farming village.

Re6IhsqOIv8,Life Probably Exists Beyond Earth - Space Science Documentary - Where Are We in the Universe?,"Since the beginning of civilization, humanity has wondered whether we are alone in the universe. As NASA has explored our solar system and beyond, it has developed increasingly sophisticated tools to address this fundamental question. Within our solar system, NASA‚Äôs missions have searched for signs of both ancient and current life, especially on Mars and soon, Jupiter‚Äôs moon Europa. Beyond our solar system, missions, such as Kepler and TESS, are revealing thousands of planets orbiting other stars. The explosion of knowledge of planets orbiting other stars, called exoplanets, and the results of decades of research on signatures of life - what scientists call biosignatures - have encouraged NASA to address, in a scientifically rigorous way, whether humanity is alone. Beyond searching for evidence of just microbial life, NASA now is exploring ways to search for life advanced enough to create technology.",science

Society has always been in a bare knuckle fight with Mother Nature. Going toe to toe with some of her more interesting jabs and punches. Testing ourselves, and oftentimes losing, to hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, Tsunamis and meteor strikes. We‚Äôve become accustomed to these attacks‚Ä¶ But‚Ä¶ every so often, nature has a trick up her sleeve; an Ace that comes out of nowhere and really floors us. 

One two strikes that although natural have no rational cause. Today we are going to list 10 strange unexplained phenomena that stomp science.

4i48EeMM1l0,25 SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS TO BLOW YOUR MIND,"Do you know that if you put an egg in vinegar for two days, the shell will dissolve and the egg will become elastic? Under the influence of vinegar, calcium, which makes up the shell, dissolves and disappears in the form of gas bubbles.  

Only the film between the shell and the egg remains intact. It turns out funny egg that looks like jelly. The egg increases slightly in size as it is saturated with vinegar. You can play with the egg as a ball. The film is very thin and, therefore, may be torn if handled carelessly. If you experiment with a boiled egg, it will become as elastic as a rubber ball. If you add a highlighter dye to vinegar, you will get a luminous elastic egg. 

I will show you how to make a similarity of crystals from sugar syrup and ice cubes. I'll show you a simple and very beautiful trick with soaring tea bags, we can call it ""Rocket Soaring"". When burning air heats up and rises up, forming a stream of hot air. When a bag burns and its weight becomes such that this flow can lift it, the light remnants of an almost burnt bag rise too.

Also look at the trick with a tennis ball and hairdryer, the trick with a candle, the trick with a balancing tin can, and others.

Have you ever heard about something that is unexplained? There are a lot of bizarre things in the world such as animals raining from the sky, or weird unexplained heat anomalies found inside the Great Pyramid of Giza. Sometimes the answer is found, and sometimes these things remain a mystery that science cannot explain. Check out these 10 Natural Phenomena that Science Can‚Äôt Explain. 

10. Mammatus clouds ‚Äì which means ""mammary cloud"", is a cellular pattern of pouches hanging underneath the base of a cloud, these are typically heavy cumulonimbus rainclouds. Mammatus are most often associated with severe weather, and they can appear before or after a storm. 

9. 'Heat anomaly' found in Great Pyramid of Giza ‚Äì Scientists have been studying the Great Pyramid of Giza, which is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and have found strange heat signatures that have no explanation.

8. Oakville Blobs - On August 7, 1994 during a rainstorm, blobs of translucent gelatinous substance fell in the town of Oakville, Washington. Several attempts were made to identify the blobs. 

7. Lake Hillier, Australia - Australia is the home of unusual ‚Äòpink lakes‚Äô. Lake Hillier is one of them. Located on Middle Island, this body of water is famous for it‚Äôs remarkable bubble gum pink color. 600 meters long and surrounded by a rim of sand and thick woods of eucalyptus trees, this pink lake still surprises and intrigues scientists.

6. Socotra Island, Yemen - Want to feel like you‚Äôre visiting another planet? Check out Socotra Island off the coast of Yemen. It has been called the most alien-looking place on Earth, and a ‚Äòlost world‚Äô because the heat and drought conditions of the island have produced around 800 rare species of flora and fauna, and a third of those can‚Äôt be seen anywhere else on the planet. 

5. Kelimutu, Indonesia - Mount Kelimutu is a volcano in Flores, Indonesia. The mountain has three volcanic crater lakes that vary colors from each other at different times, making them surreal and exciting to be discovered. 

4. Brain Injury Turns Man Into Math Genius - After being brutally attacked in 2002, Jason Padgett now sees the world through a geometric lens. His devastating injury seems to have unlocked part of his brain that makes everything in his world appear to have a mathematical structure. 

3. Stonehenge - For centuries, historians and archaeologists have puzzled over Stonehenge, which took Neolithic builders around 1,500 years to build. Located in Southern England, it is comprised of roughly 100 massive upright stones placed in a circular layout. 

2. Animal rain phenomenon - The origins of this bizarre animal rain phenomenon have evolved throughout history. The first reported phenomenon occurred in the first century AD, when Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder documented fish and frogs raining from the sky. 

1. Tsingy de Bemaraha, Madagascar - The Tsingy de Bemaraha is a national park located in the Melaky Region, northwest Madagascar. The site is unique with its biodiversity and exceptional landscape called the Tsingy - which can be translated into "" where one cannot walk barefoot"".",science

Dorothy went over one. LeVar Burton read to us under one. In a song, Kermit the Frog connected us to one. Even Mork's suspenders were made of them
Our culture, and our skies, are full of rainbows, but do you know how they form? Do we all see the same rainbow? Could cyborg-enhanced mantis shrimp eyes ever see a bigger rainbow?

TcxZSmzPw8k,The Science of Six Degrees of Separation,"Are all people on Earth really connected through just six steps?
There's much more science in this than I initially expected. It turns out ordered networks with a small degree of randomness become small-work networks. This is why your acquaintances turn out to be more important in job searches and finding new opportunities than close friends.

DON'T SEND ME AN EMAIL anymore...
1. Do not send it directly to me unless you know me.
2. Send the email to someone you have met IN PERSON and know on a first name basis AND THEY KNOW YOU.
3. Make the subject line 'Six Degrees of Veritasium'
4. Explain that you're trying to get this email to me and ask them to forward it on to me (only if they know me IRL) or someone they know who might know me.
5. If your email reaches me by Sept. 1, 2015 I will email you back and ask for your address so I can send you a postcard.

HQx5Be9g16U,10 Amazing Science Tricks Using Liquid!,"Add me on Facebook (click LIKE on Facebook to add me) - http://www.facebook.com/brusspup

iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/over-rain-single/id1033695238
Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Over-Rain-brusspup/dp/B014JXPNSW/

Detailed information for the tricks in the video:

1. Slow motion ball:

You need a thick liquid, preferably honey, a heavy ball, and a sphere shaped container. Place the heavy ball in the lower half of the sphere. Fill the lower half of the container with honey a little more than half.
If you use too little or too much, it will affect the motion of the ball.

2. Water fire starter. Credit goes to The King of Random for this idea. Be sure to check out his channel. He has a huge selection of amazing how to experiments. https://www.youtube.com/user/01032010814

You need a plastic or glass container with a curved area. The Pom bottles work great. Fill the bottle with water. Fold 2 sheets of paper in half, twice. Print or scribble a black mark on one of the sheets. On a sunny day hold the bottle near the paper, focusing the light on the black area of the paper. Once it starts to smoke and a hole begins to form, wrap the other sheet of paper around the smoking piece. Wave the papers through the air to feed oxygen to the spark. Continue this until the paper catches on fire.

3.  No-leak magic bag:
     Al you need is a zip baggy, pencils and water. Fill the bag almost to the top. Zip it shut, and start sticking pencils through the bag. Sometimes a few drops will leak out, but overall, this is a simple yet impressive trick

4. Liquid Stacking:
You'll need a tall glass or bottle. Dish Soap, vegetable oil, dark corn syrup, rubbing alcohol, water and food coloring.

First add the dark corn syrup, then dish soap, then add food coloring to the water and pour it in with the bottle tilted, then add the vegetable oil (bottle tilted), and finally add food coloring to the alcohol and pour it in with the bottle tilted.

5. Invisible Bottle:

You need glycerin, a glass and a bottle that will fit in the glass. Fill both glass and bottle with glycerin and place the bottle in the glass. It looks like the bottle disappears.

6. Dancing Liquid:

You need  a powered speaker, a tone generator (can be found online), corn starch, water and plastic to protect the speaker. Pour 1/2 cup of corn starch in a bowl and 1/4 cup of water. Mix. Pour the liquid into the speaker and generate a 60hz tone.

7. Magic Water Barrier:

You need 2 of the same glasses. Hot water, cold water, food coloring and a thin piece of plastic or cardboard. Pour the hot water in 1 glass, the cold in the other glass, add food coloring, then place the plastic on top of the hot water glass. Turn the glass upside down, place it on top of the cold water glass, then carefully remove the plastic. Hot water is less dense than cold water, so it ""floats"" on top of the cold water.

8. Leidenfrost effect:

You need a pan, water and a stove. Turn the heat on high for about 4 minutes then add the water. This experiment can stain your pans.

9. Reverse Illusion:

Add all sorts of images or words behind a glass, then watch as it reverses when you add water in the glass.

10. Reversing Liquid:

You need 1 big glass, 1 smaller glass, 3 mixing glasses, corn syrup, pipettes, food coloring, and clips.

First pour the corn syrup into the 2 bigger glasses. Place the smaller glass inside of the bigger glass. Attach the clips to prevent the smaller glass from moving side to side in the bigger glass. Pour a small amount of corn syrup into the 3 mixing glasses. Add food coloring and stir. Fill each pipette with a different color, then add the colored corn syrup to your big glass.

#NAME?,This Is What Happens When You Donate Your Body To Science,"This is what happens when you donate your body to science. Have you ever thought about donating your body to science? After all, at that point you won‚Äôt be needing it anymore, so why not leave it to someone who can put it to good use? Here‚Äôs what happens when you donate your body to science.

Summary:
Body donation is usualy overseen by an accredited organization or nonprofit, such as the donation program for a university. There is a screening process; during this process, potential donors are interviewed and examined to determine whether or not they are suitable for body donation.

Unlike organ donation, your physical age does not play a factor when it comes to donating your body to science. Doesn't matter if your 25 or 95 years old, you will always be considered a suitable potential candidate for body donation.

After screening process, the organization will keep your information on file until you pass away. Once you pass away. Once you pass away, the organization performs a medical assessment on your body to determine whether or not is still suitable for collection. 

If your chosen resting place was in the hands of a non profit program or organization, the next step is for that non profit to match your body with people who can make use of it: this usually menas that your body will go to medical researchers or educators with short term needs.

Once your body has expended its usefulness in the scientific community, your remains are cremated afterwards. If requested, your cremated remains may also be sent to your loved ones along with an official death certificate. Your next of kin may also receive a letter informing them of the experiments and scientific advancements that your body was used to facilitate. That way, all of your friends and family can know just how much of a contribution your corpse made in the name of scientific progress.

10. The Ulfberht Swords
Ulfberht swords were the weapon of choice of the Vikings, along with other tribes around northern Europe. They had a long, double edged blade, and a straight crossbar over the grip. There are only about 170 still known to exist today, each of which dates to between the 9th and 11th centuries! And the cool thing is they have the tell-tale inscription in the blade itself.

9. The Drepanosaurus
Whenever a new fossil is found, it gives further clues as to the evolution of animals, and of those that once roamed the earth. Every now and then, though, something is found that makes no sense at all in terms of scientific understanding, and requires a complete re-think of what is taken as fact. This is exactly what‚Äôs happening with a little known creature, the Drepanosaurus.

8. Rat Kings
The Rat Kings are a rare phenomena from the animal kingdom that is so bizarre, no-one is entirely sure how it happens. You may have seen one before, but if you haven‚Äôt- they really are something quite unusual. They have been a part of legend for centuries, and are formed when a number of rats become attached by the tail.

7. The Martian Meteorite
In 1984, a meteorite fell to earth, something that in itself is no unusual thing. But this one, known as ALH84001, was found to hold secrets that no-one has been able to explain. The 4.1 billion-year-old rock is thought to have originated on Mars, having been dislodged during a collision, and floated through space until it fell into earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Unlike other similar specimens, the surface of this rock had something very unusual- what appeared to be the signs of fossilised bacteria. 

6. The Longyou Grottoes
The Longyou Grottoes are a series of underground structures near the village of Shiyan Beicun, in the Zhejiang province in China. They are thought to be at least 2000 years old, but scientists and researchers have no idea how they were built, what they were used for, or even who was responsible for them.

5. What was the first dinosaur?
Since we first realized that dinosaurs roamed the earth, palaeontologists have been trying to understand the full range of creatures that once lived, with particular interest revolving around which was the first dinosaur to ever live.

4. The Nampa Stone Doll
The Nampa figurine looks like any other that has been made by an ancient civilisation. The mystery surrounding this one, though, is how it came to be in the place where it was found. It was discovered in 1889 near the town of Nampa in Idaho. Workers were searching for water, and dug a well, which involved drilling a borehole to 295 feet. 

3. The Piri Reis Map
Today we take maps for granted. Satellite technology combined with the work of cartographers over the years, plus Google of course, have created incredibly detailed depictions of our planet. All we have to do is use our smartphone! This wasn‚Äôt always the way, clearly, and maps from centuries ago were just kind of close approximations based on ship voyages.

2. The Voynich Manuscript
The 600 year old Voynich manuscript is often thought of as being the most mysterious book that has ever been written, and still, to this day, scientists aren‚Äôt able to explain what‚Äôs inside. 

1. Dinosaur and Human Footprints
The final mystery is one which calls into question the idea that humans weren‚Äôt around at the time of the dinosaurs, because their footprints have been found side by side. The discovery was made in the Paluxy river, Texas, where hundreds of dinosaur footprints have been found. Their foot impressions were perfectly preserved by the river bed.

Thanks to Guilherme (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqKjl-xepqcSTkJGR9pq_vQ) for taking us around Brazil. #Bel√©m #BrazilianFood #streetfood

BEL√âM, BRAZIL - What an amazing city for food lovers - so many unique dishes, foods, ingredients from the Amazon, and so many amazingly friendly and hospitable people. This was one of the best days of my trip to Brazil. 

Ver-o-peso Market - One this Amazonian street food tour of Belem, we started at the market, one of the must visit attractions in the city. It‚Äôs all you could want in an Amazon market - full of freshwater fish, herbs, vegetables, and fruits out of control.

Jambu Cacha√ßa - After walking around the fish market section and seeing some of the amazingly brightly colored chilies, I was introduced to Jambu Cacha√ßa, Brazil‚Äôs sugarcane liquor spiced up seriously with jambu - an Amazon tongue numbing flower and leaves. Wow, it‚Äôs serious.

Beef soup - 6 BRL ($.155) - We stopped an a friendly man selling Brazil nuts, and right then, a lady came around selling soups for breakfast. We had a beef soup, very hearty and delicious. I tried the jambu flower for the first time, so strong and so good. We then ate some Brazil nuts, a superfood packed with nutrition.

Fruit juice - There‚Äôs nothing like Amazon fruits and here‚Äôs the juices we tried: Cupua√ßu, Cacao, Bacuri, Acerola

Box da Eliana e Kelly - And here‚Äôs where this Amazon street food tour in Brazil got out of control. Our friends in Belem had organised with Eliana, from Box da Eliana e Kelly to host us for an amazing Amazon food lunch, where all their friends at the market each cooked their speciality and brought it to the table. There was so much good food and so much love I could hardly believe it. Lots of the Belem Amazon foods contained tucupi (sauce from wild manioc), jambu flowers and leaves, and Pirarucu fish.

Thank you Eliana! None of the amazing Ladies would accept payment. Please go meet them in Bel√©m!

Tacac√° Da Diva - 4 pm is the best time in Belem to eat one of the most amazing street food in the city, and I would say one of the best street foods in Brazil - Tacac√°, I still can‚Äôt believe how good it is, and how it‚Äôs not loved all over the world! We also had Vatap√°. Price - 13 BRL ($3.35) per bowl

Ros√°rio Lanches - Finally to finish this Amazon street food tour of Belem, Brazil, we went to Ros√°rio Lanches, a legendary stall. We tried both their roasted pork let and their hot dog, both of which were incredibly delicious.

What am unforgettable day of Amazonian food in Bel√©m, Brazil. Thank you to everyone who made it happen and to everyone for preparing the amazing food.

Im2gVWc2-hU,TURKISH STREET FOOD : You&#39;ve NEVER Seen this Before!!! KEBAB HEAVEN + Street Food in Izmir Turkey,"Kemeraltƒ± Bazaar Street Food tour in IZMIR, TURKEY

Welcome to the first episode of our Turkey street food series. historical KEMERALTI BAZAAR (Tarihi Kemeraltƒ± √áar≈üƒ±sƒ±)!

We start our street food tour at a famous ‚Äúb√∂rek√ßisi‚Äù for some savoury b√∂rek pastries. We ordered our b√∂rek with pastirma and cheese. It was very delicious and fun to watch the chef prepare the dish! (17 TRY / 2.92 USD)

Continuing through the ancient 7th century market, we find an extremely unique shop serving up an Izmir speciality Tur≈°u Suyu, which is pickle juice! Made up of simple ingredients to be sour, spicy and extremely refreshing. Pickle juice is best enjoyed in Izmir in the summer heat! (3 TRY / 0.52 USD)

For lunch, we try manisa kebap, hailing from the city of Manisa which is right outside of Izmir. The dish consists of kebab chunks, served on top of flatbread with a side of tomato sauce and yogurt. It is also covered in rich butter. So mouthwatering and very CHEAP! (32 TRY / 5.50 USD with unlimited tea)

Just outside of the market is the Izmir Clock Tower. It is considered the symbol of Izmir and shouldn‚Äôt be missed while you‚Äôre in the city. It is a great place to take in the views of the sea. 

We were craving something sweet and went back into the market for shambli, a semolina cake soaked in syrup, mixed with walnuts, filled with cream, and some are covered in crushed pistachio. This will give you a sugar HIGH! (regular 5 TRY / 0.86 USD + pistachio 6 TRY / 1.03 USD)

To wash it all down, Turkish coffee is like no other coffee in the world and many shops have their own unique way of making it. Turkish coffee is always unfiltered so expect it to be strong and full of silt. (7 TRY / 1.20 USD)

We made a quick stop for ‚Äúmacun‚Äù which is an Ottoman candy. It is made in the most traditional way and these vendors do not have 1 location.  (4 TRY / 0.69 USD)

For our final stop of the day, we had to eat some seafood because Izmir is quite famous for it‚Äôs fresh fish! We chose a midye dolma (translation: STUFFED MUSSELS) restaurant. These mussels are stuffed with spiced rice and locals squeeze lemon directly onto each and every mussel.These were the FRESHEST mussels we‚Äôve tried in all of Turkey! (14 TRY / 2.41 USD for half kilo)

Mombasa is a beautiful city located in Kenya, on the east coast of Africa. It‚Äôs a melting pot of a city, full of culture and delicious food. In this video, I met up with Farhana and Samil, both from Mombasa, and both love to eat.

Lighthouse - First place we headed on this Kenyan street food tour of Mombasa is along the coast called Mama Ngina drive, or Lighthouse. You‚Äôll find an abundance of small snacks along the road with a view over the cliffs of the Indian ocean. Probably my favorite street food was the fried cassava chips, which are fried fresh, put into bags, then seasoned with salt, chili powder, and lime juice.

Here are the main street food snacks we had:
Coconut, heart of palm, cassava - 340 KES ($3.33) total
Cassava chips
Roasted and fried cassava
Coconuts
Sweet potato, corn, many things

Next we headed into the heart of Mombasa to eat from a roadside shop selling a mixture of bhajias, fried potatoes, and fried chilies. This is legendary street food in Mombasa! When you order she puts all the fried things onto a plate and douses them in coconut chutney and hot sauce. The combination is delicious, and  my favorite item was the fried chilies.
Bhajia plate combo - 90 KES ($0.88)

Azad Ice Cream - We then had sugarcane juice, a Mombasa Kenyan favorite. They added sugarcane, plus ginger and lime.

Damascus Shawarma - 200 KES ($1.96) - One of the popular food trucks in Mombasa is Damascus shawarma. It was pretty good.

Abbasi Darbar - To finish off this Kenyan food tour of Mombasa, we ended with a  mega meat feast at Abbasi Darbar, a great place to fulfill all your meat needs. We ordered most of what they offer on the menu. Everything was delicious,  but I think the winner for me was the spring chicken tikka.
Total price - 1,900 KES ($18.64)

Again, thank you for Farhana for taking me on this amazing Kenyan street food tour of Mombasa, Kenya. Be sure to check out her channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCruHCa93z0-aV1DjdYtlPXQ

While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day!

At first, I thought it was biryani, but it's actually Pulao!! It was full of chickpeas!

Karachi street food is VERY delicious and famous for food lovers! In this street food video, I'm starting out by exploring burns road and finding a famous Chicken chargha, WHOLE chicken coated in masala and spice and deep fried in the richest, darkest oil. I bought a whole chicken and packed it up in a bag and kept exploring the deep back alleys near burns road for more famous Pakistani street food.

After this, I found an alleyway selling thousands and thousands of unique street foods, right off of Burns road in Karachi. I stopped at the first and most busiest stall I saw, selling famous Pakistani pakoras, samosas, jalebi desserts, and more. I ordered a few of the best street foods I saw and tried to pay but no one would accept my payment! 

Then, we're meeting up with my friends Shehroze and Alizeh to break the fast for the Iftar for Ramzan (Ramadan). We found a local restaurant and brought all the food in and purchased some extra street food and started eating!

The next day, Shehroze and Alizeh are bringing us to a very local style place to break the fast with all the locals, right under a bridge! There were HUGE pots of biryani and pulao and everyone was waiting patiently for the food. We helped serve the biryani and pulao and then had a taste for ourselves! It was one of the BEST pulao rice I've ever tasted!

In March of 2019, I took one of my favorite trips of all time when I traveled to northeast India and spent two weeks exploring the states of Assam and Meghalaya. What I found there blew my mind. The people, culture, and food were so different from what I was used to in India. My time there really broadened my mind about what India is. I hope you enjoy watching these videos as much as I enjoyed making them.

After arriving in Jorhat the previous evening and going on a nighttime street food tour, I linked back up with my boy Rishi the next morning to go on a phenomenal Indian breakfast street food tour. I was hungry, so I couldn‚Äôt wait to eat some amazing street food!

We kicked off our tour at a small, cozy spot called Laxmi. There, Rishi and I got some puri and sabji that contains chickpeas and potatoes. The puris are nice, crispy, and flaky and the sabji is so flavorful and has nice chunks of potato in it. I added some spicy chili chutney to give it a nice kick. I also got some chai, which I let sit for several minutes to let it cool off. It was super frothy and creamy but needed to sit for a little longer.

I love to make mini tacos with the puri and sabji. They‚Äôre so good together. The dish comes with three puris, so you get more than enough to finish off your sabji, but you can always get more. Everything was so good that I got a second helping of all of it, including the chai! Our total came to 70 rupees (or just over $1 U.S.) for both of us together. What a deal!

From there, we got back on Rishi‚Äôs scooter and headed to a local market. The streets were pretty wild! There were people, cars, and cows everywhere! The shop Rishi took me to didn‚Äôt have a name. There, we got rotis and more sabji. This sabji came with a lot more chickpeas and less potatoes than the first one and was served with a spicy chutney on the side. It also contained greens, which was different.

The chutney was different and not as spicy as the last one. It contained some fruits and veggies and was really nice. It was almost like a salsa! I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the roti (I actually preferred the puri from the last place) but the sabji was amazing! It only cost 25 rupees, or about $0.36 U.S. 

Before our next food spot, we stopped at a Rajmao Pukhuri, a huge pond in the center of Jorhat. This pond is man-made and was constructed by the Ahoms. There are no turtles or ducks there, but there are fish in its waters!

From the pond, we set off to our next destination. Jorhat was an interesting place. It wasn‚Äôt small, but at the same time, it wasn‚Äôt huge either. My hotel was in the central business district but we were making our way through the suburbs where people live. There were lots of vendors selling fruit and clothes by the side of the road.

We arrived at Crunchy Bites to have some raj kachori. I‚Äôd never had it before. It‚Äôs a big, crunchy kachori that‚Äôs stuffed with potatoes, tomatoes, onions, sev, white sauce, tamarind chutney, and masala. It‚Äôs an amazing-looking chaat and it tastes as good as it looks! It didn‚Äôt contain any spice but had tons of flavors, including something similar to sour cream and the sweetness from the tamarind chutney.

I loved breaking pieces of the kachori into the filling and eating it all together. It was so yummy and filling! It was the best thing I ate that day but I was too full to finish it! The raj kachori only cost 60 rupees, or $0.86 U.S.

Next, we visited an inexpensive central market. You have to cross a bridge to get to it. The market contains six different lanes and lots of tiny stalls, some of them only 5 feet in width. I couldn‚Äôt wait to do some shopping!

There were lots of clothing shops, as well as others selling jewelry, shoes, and backpacks. There was a stall selling spices and mouth fresheners as well as onions and peppers. There were lots of spice shops and others selling flattened rice. There were also tailors. This place is only visited by locals, so it‚Äôs a real, immersive experience!

I hope you enjoyed coming along on my breakfast street food and market tour in Jorhat! If you did, please give it a thumbs up and leave me a comment! And please subscribe to my channel so you don‚Äôt miss any of my upcoming travel/food content!

On Day 27 in Lisbon, Portugal, I made up my mind to eat as much Portuguese food and at some of the best local restaurants in Lisbon. It turned out to be a fantastic day in Lisbon with some seriously good Portuguese food!

00:36 Cafe Martinho Da Arcada at Pra√ßa do Com√©rcio - The first place we stopped in the morning is a legendary cafe in Lisbon that is the oldest cafe in Lisbon called Cafe Martinho Da Arcada. The main reason I wanted to go there was to try their past√©is de bacalhau, classic Portuguese food codfish fritters. The coffee and ambience and of the cafe was also nice. Total price - 9.30 EUR

Restaurante Z√© da Mouraria (I think it was closed for holidays) - I really wanted to eat at this restaurant during my visit to Lisbon, but unfortunately they were closed for holidays, so if you go to Lisbon and are looking for local Portuguese food, check this place out.

5:32 Restaurante Cantinho do Aziz - For our next meal, although not Portuguese food, but more Mozambican food, we headed over to Restaurante Cantinho do Aziz. The food was remarkable, one of the best meals I had in Lisbon. I first began with some beef samosas which were insanely good, and then had spicy bakra piri piri, spicy lamb ribs. Total price - 35.00 EUR

11:14 Restaurante A Merendinha do Arco - Finally, to try some authentic Portuguese food in Lisbon, we headed over to a restaurant called Restaurante A Merendinha do Arco. This small family run restaurant serves delicious Portuguese food and many of the classics. I ordered bacalhau com gr√£o, codfish with garbanzo beans and carne de porco √† alentejana, pork with clams. Along with the delicious local food, what I loved was the ambiance and feel of the restaurant. Total price - 20.15 EUR

22:10 Ocean√°rio de Lisboa (Entrance price - 17 EUR per person) - By this point on this Portuguese food tour of Lisbon, I was feeling pretty full, so we headed over to Ocean√°rio de Lisboa and walked around one of Europe‚Äôs biggest aquariums.

24:22 Cafe on Avenida da Liberdade (Coffee - 1.40 EUR) - One of the things I love about Lisbon is the social cafe culture and atmosphere. In the afternoon I was starting to feel pretty sleepy, so before dinner, I had a cup of coffee at an outdoor cafe along Avenida.

25:12 Solar dos Presuntos - For the last Portuguese meal in on this food tour of restaurants in Lisbon, I decided to eat at a restaurants called Solar dos Presuntos. I didn‚Äôt know it was going to be such a fancy high end restaurant, but it was our last night in Lisbon, so we decided to go for it. I started with the pata negra, a plate of incredibly good ham. Then I ordered the polvo √† lagareiro, some of the most tender octopus I‚Äôve ever had in my life. Finally we also ordered dourada grelhada - gilt-head sea bream fish. The food was expensive, but delicious. Total price - 60.85 EUR.

This was a fantastic day of Portuguese food in Lisbon, and many of the places we ate today were the best restaurants I tried in Lisbon.

GMPh6t-lwjM,"Indian STREET FOOD Tour at Night - Momos, Vada Pav &amp; Chicken Tandoori | Jorhat, Assam, India","Subscribe to my channel ‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/DBH-SUB 
Check out my blog ‚ñ∫ http://davidsbeenhere.com/ 

One of the things I love the most about travel is that destinations are never just one thing. They‚Äôre multi-layered and diverse. A prime example of that is India, a country I‚Äôve now visited three times. The states of Assam and Meghalaya in northeast India, which I explored in March of 2019, are so different from other parts of the country, from the people to the culture to the landscapes to the food. It‚Äôs so exciting to get more of a sense of what India is and I‚Äôm thrilled to share this gorgeous and unique region with you!

Follow Rishi on Instagram: www.instagram.com/collosal_appetite

My first night in the Assamese city of Jorhat continued as my friend Rishi and I headed out on a nighttime street food tour I will never forget! Jorhat is very close to China, so there are lots of Chinese and even Mongolian influences in the cuisine there. I couldn‚Äôt wait to taste them for myself!

First, we headed to Break Time to get some momos. These momos are steamed first and then fried. A rich and spicy red sauce with pepper and chilies is made and the momos are stir-fried with it. These momos weren‚Äôt too hot and I loved the red sauce! They were the best fried momos I‚Äôd ever had. They were still crunchy on the outside and super juicy in the middle. The chicken inside was minced and perfectly cooked. They‚Äôre super filling and were like spicy, Szechwan-inspired momos. I was in love with them! You get a massive plate of them for only 60 rupees, or roughly $0.86 U.S.

Next, we headed back out and got some Vada Pav at Delhi Chaat House. Vada Pav is a potato fritter that is served on a bun with chutneys and is sometimes referred to as an Indian burger. I‚Äôd had it before in Mumbai and Pune and couldn‚Äôt wait to try it again. It was served with mustard, sweet sauce, coriander chutney, and a spicy sauce. The sweet sauce was so tasty. The bun was super fluffy and the spicy sauce was really hot! I also loved the coriander chutney. It was an amazing potato mash sandwich! It only cost about 40 rupees, or about $0.58 U.S.  

After that, we continued our street food tour by heading back out and getting some spicy chicken wings at Seev‚Äôs. They use the second spiciest peppers in the world, ghost peppers, in their wings. There was a honey glazed sauce on it that contained the peppers. The chicken wasn‚Äôt that hot but was super juicy. The heat made my lips tingle a little bit as I continued eating.

We also got some double-marinated chicken tandoori drumsticks, which had a thick, white sauce on them. I loved the smoky flavor and the glaze was so creamy and cheesy. I was in love with them! I added some mint chutney to them which was great. The sauce was like a soft brie cheese. Our total there came to 450 rupees ($6.49 U.S.): 250 ($3.60 U.S.) for the wings and 200 ($2.88 U.S.) for the tandoori drumsticks.

Next, we were back on the streets of Jorhat to get some spicy pani puri! Pani Puri is my favorite Indian dish of all time and my mouth was all set for a spicy version of it! They‚Äôre made of leavened, hollow flatbread that is filled with an aloo (potato) mixture, chilies, onions, pani (spiced water), and a spicy sauce. It was super hot and really good. I loved the crunch and chunks of potato. I‚Äôd never had pani puri this spicy! It costs 10 rupees ($0.14 U.S.) for 5 puris and the vendor keeps giving you more until you say you‚Äôre done.

The vendor also gave me a dry one without pani that I liked even better! I could honestly eat pani puri forever. The dry ones without the pani were so fantastic! I loved them so much. They were both spicy and sweet and had an incredible flavor combination. And even though it‚Äôs 10 rupees for 5, the vendor actually gives you an extra one for free!

Our final destination was Ice Station, where we got some rose lassi. I hadn‚Äôt had lassi in a while and I wanted to cool my mouth off after the spicy pani puri. It was delicious and milky and more like a shake. They put nuts on top, which add a nice crunch. I‚Äôd had a thicker lassi in Amritsar but I really liked this one, too. It had a nice rose flavor and helped me beat the fiery feeling in my mouth, so it did the trick! 

I hope you loved my nighttime street food tour of Jorhat! If you did, please give it a thumbs up and leave me a comment. Also, please subscribe to my channel.

When I was in Dubai, I had the privilege of hanging out and eating with my friend Peyman (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu2SDLtoqPZlZYgbyMI5c2A). He‚Äôs from Dubai, he loves to eat, and he knows some of the best food spots in Dubai. So in this Dubai food tour, we went around and ate Emirati food, rice and lamb, street food, karak tea, and finally ended with home cooked Emirati food at Peyman‚Äôs home.

One thing I want to quickly mention, and Peyman and I discussed this in the video as well, is that Emirati food at restaurants is still not very common in Dubai. This is because there are so many international restaurants in Dubai, and local Emiratis typically just eat their food at home. But things are changing and there is starting to be a higher demand for Emirati food in Dubai.

Al Fanar Restaurant - One of the only full Emirati food restaurants in Dubai. We ordered Luqaimat, Tharid, Madrooba, Balaleet. All the food was fantastic, and it‚Äôs a nice environment.
Total price - 280 AED ($76.21)

Karak - 0.50 AED ($0.14) per cup - This is originally adapted from India, but it‚Äôs a full part of the culture in UAE, and you can get cups of karak tea right to your car.

Al Marhabani Restaurant - Mandi is one of the greatest Arabian food dishes, originally from Yemen. It includes rice and meat that‚Äôs traditionally cooked in an underground oven. The lamb here was outstanding.
Total price - 200 AED ($54.44)

Al Labeeb Grocery - Regag bread - This is a little gem of a shop that Peyman took me to. They make some Dubai street food style crepes with cheese and fish sauce, and it‚Äôs awesome.
Price - 6 AED ($1.63) each

Machboos - Finally at Peyman‚Äôs house for dinner, he cooked machboos, one of the national dishes of UAE. It was a great way to end this Dubai food tour!

Thank you for watching this Dubai food tour!

Huge thank you to Fadhlur for reaching out and taking us on a Malaysian street food tour of Kuala Lumpur. It was an amazing day, and I have so much love to Malaysia as it was one of the first countries where I started making street food videos - as you‚Äôll see in the video!

Ok, here are all the street food stalls and restaurants we ate at on this tour:

Mansion Tea Stall
The thing to order here is the roti canai special, roti that chopped up, then doused in a variety of curry sauces, sambal, and a few soft boiled eggs. It‚Äôs a perfect way to begin your day in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 2.80 RM ($0.68) per plate

Nasi Lemak Tanglin
Nasi lemak is often considered the national food of Malaysia, and there are plenty of places to eat it throughout Kuala Lumpur. Having been around since 1948, Nasi Lemak Tanglin is a place I had wanted to go for a while. It was overall very good, with a nice laid back atmosphere and surrounded by nature. Nasi lemak - about 8 RM ($1.94) per plate

Ikan Bakar Seri Melaka (Jalan Bellamy)
One of my favorite places to eat ikan bakar, grilled fish, is on Jalan Bellamy. Back in 2012, I had to hike over a highway and climb a few fences to get there as I was only on foot. In this video, I‚Äôm a bit older, and we had a car! The ikan bakar was just as good as I remember it. Total price - 68 RM ($16.51) for everything

Sri Ganapathi Mess
One of the best things about Malaysian food is its incredible diversity, including Malay, Chinese, and Indian food. Banana leaf south Indian food is very popular and I was recommended to try Sri Ganapathi Mess, a restaurant tucked away into a home. An amazing south Indian food experience in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 59 RM ($14.32) for 4 people

Kedai Kopi Lai Foong
Finally, another dish that many had recommended me was the unique clam noodles in Kuala Lumpur Chinatown at the legendary Kedai Kopi Lai Foong. It was delicious, and a perfect way to end an amazing Malaysian street food tour in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 10 RM ($2.43) per bowl

e2RBRUFwmuw,Indonesian Street Food Tour of Glodok (Chinatown) in Jakarta - DELICIOUS Indonesia Food!,"‚ñ∫Check out 50 of the Best Indonesian Dishes: https://migrationology.com/indonesian-food/

Glodok is the Chinatown of Jakarta, and my wife and I decided to spend the day walking around Glodok and exploring some Indonesian street food throughout the day. At the end of the day, we also stopped by Fatahillah Square, with is an old Dutch square in colonial Jakarta, where you'll find some interesting buildings and some street food snacks as well.

Since we were staying at a hotel (here‚Äôs information on the hotel I stayed at:https://migrationology.com/travel-guides/jakarta-indonesia/)  not too far from Glodok, we decided to beat the traffic and just walk over there. It didn‚Äôt take more than 15 minutes to walk, and soon we arrived in Jakarta‚Äôs Chinatown. Glodok is a very interesting area to walk around and explore. There are fresh markets and plenty of restaurants and food to choose from.

The Indonesian street food I tried on this tour was siomay, an Indonesian Chinese dish. From the back of a motorbike, I chose a few of the siomay dumplings he had steaming, and the cut them up and added some peanut sauce to the plate. The texture was a little mushy, but they were alright. Right opposite the siomay, the owner of an Indonesian vegetarian restaurant greeted me and asked if I might like to eat some of his vegetarian food. His vegetarian rendang was particularly good.

One of the most famous places to go in Glodok is Kopi Es Tak Kie, a legendary coffee shop. After wandering around a while we found it. I had a cup of coffee and also a plate of nasi campur from outside the shop.

We continued on our Indonesian street food tour throughout Glodok and I tried a sweet snack called kue ape, which is a green colored little pancake. Next, I had a variety of deep fried snacks including fried bananas, and fried breadfruit. They are definitely pretty greasy, but interesting to sample, and they are very popular street food snacks in Indonesia.

It probably wasn‚Äôt the greatest idea to walk, but we decided to walk over to Fatahillah Square. The traffic was pretty intense, but we made it. And along with checking out the old colonial buildings one of my main goals was to try kerak telor, which is a traditional Indonesian Betawi street food snack. Luckily I found it and it turned out to be a very interesting and amazing snack to watch being made!

Here‚Äôs the list of the things we ate and the prices:

Siomay - 15,000 IDR ($1.11)
Vegetarian food - 20,000 IDR ($1.48)
Kopi Es Tak Kie - 10,000 IDR ($0.73) 
Nasi campur - 35,000 IDR ($2.58)

Kue ape - 1,000 IDR ($0.07) each
Fried snacks - 12,000 ($0.88)
Kerak telor - 20,000 IDR ($1.48) - Possibly overcharged? Do you think?

Hope you enjoyed the Indonesian street food tour of Glodok and Fatahillah Square, I sure enjoyed eating it!

Even though the city of Hyderabad is more famous for its legendary quintessential non vegetarian wonders that are evidently more conspicuous in its culinary landscape, there is absolutely no dearth of delectable native or popular vegetarian delights in the city. So in this fun filled gastronomic sojourn we braced ourselves to gorge on some delicious vegetarian street side dishes that are widely popular among  the locals. Our host, Sankalp Vishnu, a renowned food expert in the city, took us around the vibrant locality across P G Road, Sindhi colony, Secunderabad that is well known for a wide range of regional vegetarian street food offerings. Let‚Äôs get started.

Our first stop was Top and Tasty, where we tried the Indo chinese style Manchuria pav bhaji. This innovative take on the regular pav bhaji was indeed very delicious. The garlic,red chilli punch as imbibed from the manchurian style of cooking made the dish surprisingly indulgent. 

The second stop was Shivaling Chaat corner where we tried a delicious serving of Hyderabadi style matar(yellow pea) chaat. This savoury and tangy playful dish was topped with sweetened curd, sev and sweet chutney. Unlike its North Indian counterparts, this chaat was served hot. Though that didn't diminish the fun.

The third joint that we stopped by was the Chachaji food cart where we got to taste a delicious Dabeli, a popular Gujarati snack. The perfectly balanced sweet and savoury flavour of the Dabeli was beautifully complemented by the super tasty peanut chutney. It‚Äôs a must try snack if you love the sweet notes in your dish.

The fourth place where we halted was a dosa kiosk named Dosa Verito,right outside the Mayur Pan shop. It boasts of 151 varieties of dosas. After much deliberation we settled for the macaroni pasta dosa and blueberry ice cream dosa. The former one was super cheesy and irresistible while the latter one was a truly luscious fusion treat. 

Our fifth stop was Bombay chaat house where we tried the Hyderabadi version of the Mumbai special Vada Pav. The dry garlic chutney and the unusual garnish of chopped onions enhanced its taste. 

From there we went on to our sixth stop, the Famous and Live Soda where we tried their best selling item the digest soda that is essentially soda mixed with a concentrate prepared with sugar and digestive spices like cumin ,rock salt etc. It was super refreshing and appeasing. 

This delectable veg street food journey concluded with a Paan treat from the popular paan shop in the area the Dimmy‚Äôs Paan Place. Its was a perfect way to end this awesome exploration. 

We confer our heartfelt thanks to Sankalp Bhai for introducing us to the best veg street food offerings.

pBPXxO9E-fQ,West African Food - EXOTIC DELICACY in GHANA!,"‚ñ∫SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe
‚ñ∫T-shirts and caps available now: https://migrationology.com/store/

Bushmeat is a term that is used to often describe wild game meat in Africa. And while there some types of bushmeat that are not good or unsafe to eat - grasscutter - also known as a greater cane rat, is safe and one of the most popular types of bushmeat to eat in West Africa. It‚Äôs a delicacy!

So while we were driving on our way to Elmina, Ghana, along the side of the highway, we stopped at some hunters, and bought a grasscutter. 

Later in the day, we met up with our host family, and we drove over to the Elmina fishing market. The market was amazing, bright and colorful, and energetic, with some unique fish and seafood available from the Atlantic. We bought some fish to go along with our grasscutter, and then we continued back to the house to start cooking.

First for lunch, Mama made us a dish called Eto, a mash up of yam and palm nut oil, topped with eggs. It was a little on the dry side for me, but it was an honor to have a chance to try that special Ghanaian dish.

For dinner we prepared the fish and grasscutter. The fish was made into Ghanaian groundnut or peanut soup, which is one of the best dishes I at in Ghana. The grasscutter was made into a bushmeat grasscutter light soup which included chilies, garlic, onions, ginger, and tomato.

Finally, for the main start of the meal Mama made omo tuo, Ghana style rice balls.

How does grasscutter taste? The greater cane rats run around the fields and eat grass, so unsurprisingly some parts kind of taste like grass. But they are a white meat, and have a similar look to chicken, but the meat is even sweeter. It was also surprisingly fall apart tender. I thought it was amazing!

Across West African food, grasscutter is a very popular meat, and a delicacy eaten on special occasions.

We had one full day in Zurich, Switzerland, and I wanted to make the most of it by going on a Swiss food tour, eating as much food as possible, and walking around and seeing some of the most famou sights and attractions in the beautiful city of Zurich.

Here are all the details about everything you‚Äôll find in this video:

Z√ºrich, Switzerland

Caf√© Henrici - To begin the day for Swiss breakfast, we stopped to have a cup of coffee, and also I wanted a croissant, but they were all out of the morning already, so I settled for a few small slices of bread. It was excellent.
Total price for 3 people - 24.40 CHF ($25.75)

Lindenhof Hill - This is a great place to get a view over Old Zurich, and it puts the city into perspective and helps you get your bearings, and the views are beautiful.

Swiss Chuchi - Thank you to Marcel for this recommendation. In Switzerland for a single day, I needed to eat one of the most well known of all Swiss food, cheese fondue. At Swiss Chuchi restaurant, we enjoyed both cheese fondue and raclette, both of which were excellent and the most cheese I‚Äôve had in a  single meal in a very long time.
Total price - 126 CHF ($132.98)
That included all I ate, and 2 other plates  of food.

Grossm√ºnster - This church is one of the most recognizable landmarks of Zurich. For a small fee, you can pay to climb to the top of the tower for an amazing view.
Price -  4 CHF ($4.22)

Lake Zurich - The city of Zurich is surrounds Lake Zurich, which is unbelievably clean and pure.

Kronenhalle Restaurant  - This is one of the most legendary and classic restaurants in all of Zurich, Switzerland. I didn‚Äôt realized it was so expensive and so high end, but we decided to go for it anyway, because I was looking forward to trying their Z√ºrcher Geschnetzeltes, the most well known of all Zurich Swiss food dishes consisting of thin sliced potato paired with veal stew. It‚Äôs quite a stunning dish and the version at Kronenhalle Restaurant was absolutely stunning.
Total price - 126 CHF ($132.98)

Bahnhofstrasse Shopping street 

Rheinfelder Bierhalle - To finish off this ultimate Swiss food tour of Zurich in a single day we went to Rheinfelder Bierhalle, a beer hall and restaurant in Zurich. I ordered their specialty, Jumbo Jumbo Cordon Bleu. Cordon bleu is another one of the Swiss food dishes you don‚Äôt want  to miss when you‚Äôre in Zurich.

Thank you very much for watching this  Swiss food tour!

There are few cities in the world that can compare to Jerusalem in terms of ancient history and religious significance. It‚Äôs one of the most fascinating cities in the world, and it‚Äôs a city that I‚Äôve wanted to visit my entire life. Finally, along with my friend David (https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry.tourist/) and Rafram, we explored Jerusalem to discover the food treasures the city has to offer - and let me tell you, you‚Äôll find some incredibly delicious food in Jerusalem!
 
We started off the Jerusalem food tour by first walking around East Jerusalem and starting with the best plate of hummus I‚Äôve ever had. We then toured around Old Jerusalem, and enjoyed some incredible Palestinian food kebabs cooked by an incredible man who cooked with serious love and passion. Another highlight in Jerusalem was the mutabak, a thin  pastry stuffed with cheese and baked.

After eating our way through Old Jerusalem, we then headed into West Jerusalem and went to lunch at an Israeli Jewish restaurant serving a mix of amazing dishes. The food was home-cooked in style, and absolutely sensation. A few more snacks and sightseeing throughout the afternoon, and that brought us all the way to dinner where David had made reservations to eat at one of the hottest restaurants in Jerusalem, Machneyuda Restaurant. It was quite an experience, and an amazing meal and lively atmosphere to wrap up this ultimate Jerusalem food tour.

Here‚Äôs all the food and places included in this Palestinian food and Israeli food tour of Jerusalem:

Hummus Acramawi
Price - 20 ILS ($5.57) per plate

Almond juice - 3.90 ILS ($1.09)

Al-shuala Grill Restaurant
Shawarma - 26 ILS ($7.26)

Al Baghdadi Kabab
Palestinian kebabs
Total price - 100 ILS ($27.89)

Zalatimo Sweets
Mutabak
Price - 30 ILS ($8.37) each

Peaches - 10 for 1 kg
Plums - 10 for 1 kg
Fruit - 10 ILS ($2.76) per kg.

Mahane Yehuda Market
Azura Restaurant
Total price - 400 ILS ($111.55)

Western Wall (Wailing Wall)
Western Wall Tunnel
Price - 35 ILS ($9.76) per person

Dome of the Rock

Mount of Olives

Machneyuda Restaurant
Total price - 700 ILS ($195.21)

It was a lot of food in a single day, but it was one of the greatest food and learning days that I‚Äôve ever had in my life. The generosity of the people we connected with, paired with the food, was truly a memorable experience in Jerusalem.

Thank you again to David (https://www.instagram.com/the.hungry.tourist/) and Rafram for showing me some of the best food in Jerusalem!

YvlYjLPgrCE,Street Food in Ghana - GIANT CHOP-BAR LUNCH and West African Food Tour in Accra!,"This was an incredible day of street food in Ghana!
‚ñ∫Check out Jay: https://www.instagram.com/mukasechic/
‚ñ∫SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe
‚ñ∫T-shirts and caps available now: https://migrationology.com/store/

Jay (Mukase Chic) is an amazing woman, so positive and talented, and so much fun to hang out with and eat with! She‚Äôs a food personality, a chef, a restauranteur, a blogger - she‚Äôs incredible. Check out her Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/mukasechic/) and YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8y8uGewOe2NAuNQALV_uaw). 

Anyway, so Jay took me an ultimate street food tour in Accra, here‚Äôs all the amazing food we ate:

Red red (bean stew) and plantain - This was the first stop, a small stall that Jay has been eating at for years. They fry plantain, and then serve the plantain along with beans stewed in palm nut oil, and combine it with gari, which are cassava flakes. The result, is a filling and very satisfying combination of sweet and tangy plantains with salty oily beans. What‚Äôs key as Jay explained to me is the palm nut oil, which provides so much oil and fragrance. It was delicious, and a perfect way to begin this Ghanaian street food tour in Accra!
Total price - 4 GHC ($0.90)

Nima Market - Next we caught a taxi to Nima Market, known for its spices. We tried everything we could find, which was quite a lot of snacks here and there. The market was fantastic to walk around, full of action and energy.
Coconut toffee
Tigernuts - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Masa - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Zowey (adaakwa) - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Kulikuli - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Boiled egg - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Fried cheese - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Burkina - 3 GHC ($0.70)
Bofrot - 1 GHC ($0.20)

Peace Chop Bar (Chop Bar - Local Ghanaian restaurant) - Finally, to end this street food tour of Ghana in Accra, we stopped back at the chop bar that we had visited earlier in the morning. Seeing the cooking was sensational, it only made me hungrier for lunch. By the time we arrived back, they had already sold out of a few dishes, but there was still plenty enough to choose from. I tried the banku with goat meat, and it was fantastic.
Total price - 36 GHC ($7.90)

This was an incredible day of eating street food in Accra. Many thanks to Jay!

Today,  I'm (The Food Ranger, Trevor James)  bringing you into Peshawar, Pakistan, for a FULL ON street food tour of Peshawar,  part 2! Peshawar is a famous old market town Pakistan with some of the biggest street food markets in the country. Peshawar's markets are full of delicious street food and tons of famous Pakistani cuisine. In one block, you can find SUPERHUMAN curry, Chapli Kababs AKA Chapli Kebabs,, chicken sajji, paya, and much more. Flying in to eat the street food in Pakistan is a great travel decision, and coming to Peshawar at the core is the best place in Pakistan to experience the street food scene! Peshawar has one of the richest street food scenes in the world! 

In today's street food video we're going Foodrangin' for tons of FAMOUS Pakistan Street Food - including the AMAZING famous Peshawar Chapli Kababs (Kebabs), HUGE Pulao Mountains, and UNSEEN street foods like Pakistani street food scrambled eggs and superhuman curry! There's so much street food in this video, you have to watch the whole Pakistani street food vlog! We're also bringing you to some ULTRA RARE Peshawar fried fish! There's so much Pakistani street food!! 

To start out our huge Peshawar street food tour, we're bringing you to a SUPER FAST street curry vendor, the CHENNA MASTER of Peshawar! He was ULTRA speedy the way he scooped up the chenna, and here, it was UPGRADED with a big scoop of mint chutney! One of the best street foods in the world! It was full of masala and very delicious! 

After this, we're bringing you foodrangin' even more and bringing you to a couple FAMOUS street foods in Peshawar. 

The first is a local Pakistani street food that is famous all throughout the country, but best here in Peshawar, the chapli kababs (kebabs). The kebab patties were full of local spices and masala and also hundreds of fried eggs! They were really heavy but so SATISFYING!! They were definitely one of the best street foods to try in Pakistan!

After this, we're bringing you to a famous Pulao to try in Pakistan, the Kabuli Pulao, but here, at the Shinwari Kabuli Pulao in Peshawar, it is even better! The GIANT pot is loaded up with tons of basmati and beef stock, and then after it's cooked using their secret masala and local Pakistani recipe, is loaded up with the most tender and fatty beef and huge scoops of carrot and raisin! It's sweet and also very fragrant and fatty and succulent! One of the best Pulao dishes in the world! 

After tasting the Kabuli Pulao, we walked down a busy market street of Peshawar and found a famous fried fish shop! Here, huge filets of fish are fried in a dark oil and covered in a spicy masala and served with lemon. It was super soft and juicy fish meat! 

After this, we found one of the most unique street foods in Pakistan, the 5 egg scramble with LIVER!  It was loaded with tomato and green chili and huge chunks of liver! It was quite spicy and very oily but also very satisfying!

After this, to finish off the day, we went right across the street from the 5 egg Pakistani style to try a local curry shop. Here, it was SUPERHUMAN curry because the flavours were some of the BEST in the world, SUPER DELICIOUS! There were over 20 curries to choose from and it was a delight to be able to choose the ones you like!

I hope you're enjoying this big Pakistani street food video series! Thanks so much for watching, I would love to hear from you down below!

Chinese Street Food Shanghai - Chinese Street Food - Street Food China
Chinese street food and Chinese Food in China is incredibly delicious! So I flew to Shanghai, China and have been eating street food, noodles, and dumplings non-stop. Best Street Food to try! The Chinese food is so good in Shanghai! I've eaten street food in Bejing, street food in Chengdu, street food in Xi‚Äôan, street food in Guangzhou, and now, street food in Shanghai. A lot of the street food in Shanghai is similar to other street food in China. You can find some unique Shanghai street food specialties here, like xiaolongbao (soup dumplings), shengjianbao (pan fried dumplings), seafood on the street, and some delicious noodles as well. You can also enjoy countless other street foods in Shanghai, many featured in this video.

The Mughal Empire (also referred to as Baburid Empire, Baburid Dynasty) was founded by Zahiriddin Muhammad Babur, a Timurid prince and ruler from Turan or Turkistan, i.e. Central Asia (Uzbekistan). Babur was a direct descendant to the Turkic Emperor Timur on his father's side and also had links to Chagatai, the second son of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, on his mother‚Äôs side.Ousted from his ancestral domains in Turkistan by Sheybani Khan, the 14-year old Prince Babur turned to India to satisfy his ambitions. He established himself in Kabul and then pushed steadily southward into India from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass. Babur's forces occupied much of northern India after his victory at Panipat in 1526. The preoccupation with wars and military campaigns, however, did not allow the new emperor to consolidate the gains he had made in India.The instability of the empire became evident under his son, Humayun, who was driven out of India and into Persia by rebels.Humayun's exile in Persia established diplomatic ties between the Safavid and Mughal Courts, and led to increasing West Asian cultural influence in the Mughal court. The restoration of Mughal rule began after Humayun‚Äôs triumphant return from Persia in 1555, but he died from a fatal accident shortly afterwards.Humayun's son, Akbar, succeeded to the throne under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped consolidate the Mughal Empire in India.

Through warfare and diplomacy, Akbar was able to extend the empire in all directions, and controlled almost the entire Indian subcontinent north of the Godavari river. He created a new class of nobility loyal to him from the military aristocracy of India's social groups, implemented a modern government and supported cultural developments. At the same time Akbar intensified trade with European trading companies. The Indian historian Abraham Eraly wrote that foreigners were often impressed by the fabulous wealth of the Mughal court, but the glittering court hid darker realities, namely that about a quarter of the empire's gross national product was owned by 655 families while the bulk of India's 120 million people lived in appalling poverty.After suffering what appears to have been an epileptic seizure in 1578 while hunting tigers, which he regarded as a religious experience, Akbar grew disenchanted with Islam, and came to embrace a syncretistic mixture of Hinduism and Islam.Akbar allowed free expression of religion and attempted to resolve socio-political and cultural differences in his empire by establishing a new religion, Din-i-Ilahi, with strong characteristics of a ruler cult. He left his successors an internally stable state, which was in the midst of its golden age, but before long signs of political weakness would emerge. Akbar's son, Jahangir, ruled the empire at its peak, but he was addicted to opium, neglected the affairs of the state, and came under the influence of rival court cliques. During the reign of Jahangir's son, Shah Jahan, the culture and splendour of the luxurious Mughal court reached its zenith as exemplified by the Taj Mahal.The maintenance of the court, at this time, began to cost more than the revenue

XE3XJK8CG6I,5 Most Amazing Accidental Historical Discoveries,"5 Most Amazing Accidental Historical Discoveries

Rich soil always appreciates good care so it can provide miraculous natural gifts to the farmer. However, James Bristle, a farmer from Michigan, got something more exciting from the ground. He had a field to grow soybeans and one day he noticed something sticking out of the ground that looked like an old decayed fence post at first sight. However, the find turned out to be much more amazing. James got an excavator to dig deeper and was stunned to see a well-preserved skull. These were the bones of a wooly mammoth that lived on the planet about 15,000 years ago. The multiton giant was approximately 40 years old when it died. Archaeologists found most of the animal‚Äôs skeleton, including the almost intact skull with tusks, though they did not find its limbs. Apparently, some hunters separated and took the limbs and put the mammoth‚Äôs body in storage. It is noteworthy that James exercised his right to keep some of the mammoth remains and gave most of the bones and the skull to a local museum. That was the first discovery, let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs next!",history

[This Is The Greatest Bank Heist in Chinese History]

Handan, China; October 10th, 2006. It was getting dark.

The vault manager of the Agricultural Bank of China was on edge. He was afraid. He felt something wasn‚Äôt quite right. Yes there were two security guards patrolling the grounds, which made him feel safer, but as vault manager he needed to be sure himself. 

He checked the printer room, the conference room, there was no one there, no sign of trouble. 

Then he entered the vault‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶where everything was also fine; the money was there, the bank‚Äôs security system was down. In fact, everything was just as he planned. 

He started counting the money, but he knew he had to be quick, the paranoia was starting to get to him. He shoved the cash in his duffel bag, and swiftly left the vault. 

For Ren Xiaofeng, it was good to be the man in charge, it made robbing the Agricultural Bank of China that much easier. 

But he still had to be careful, he wasn‚Äôt out of the woods yet....",history

7x5KesH3dzM,Ugly History: Witch Hunts - Brian A. Pavlac,"Uncover the history of the witch hunts that swept through Europe and the American colonies from the 15th century until the 18th century.

--

In the German town of N√∂rdlingen in 1593, innkeeper Maria H√∂ll found herself accused of witchcraft. She was arrested for questioning, and denied the charges. She insisted she wasn‚Äôt a witch through 62 rounds of torture before her accusers finally released her. Other accused witches weren‚Äôt so ‚Äúlucky."" Why did these witch hunts occur? Brian A. Pavlac digs into this horrific chapter in human history.

History of the Cold War (in One Take) by History Bombs

The Cold War was a vast, global conflict that lasted from 1945 - 1991 and had a significant impact on many regions of the world. 

Towards the end of World War Two, the communist Soviet Union and capitalist United States of America began to vie for dominance as they asserted themselves as global superpowers, capable of extending their influence worldwide.

From the Potsdam Conference to the fall of the Berlin Wall, this video charts the course of the Cold War, including Kennan's Long Telegram, the Berlin Airlift, the Sino-Soviet Alliance, the Korean War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War and the Soviet-Afghan War.

Human history is truly a swinging pendulum of ups and downs. The centuries have been sprinkled with both terrible, bleak events, and beautiful hopeful moments.

Since the invention of the photograph, those events and moments have been recorded for us, allowing us a window into a time that we never actually got to see for ourselves.

Nobody Showed You the History Of India Like This

This is India! Just look how beautiful, magical and spiritual this place is. Green trees, deep blue rivers, hot shining sun‚Ä¶ India. Are you ready to travel back in time again? Buckle up because it‚Äôs going to be a long rough ride! 

Once upon a time, or to be more accurate, around 70,000 years ago people in Africa decided that they got tired of living with angry hungry neighbors aka hungry animals. They left the continent and reached India. It was a long hard way. The scientists will later call it the coastal migration. Yep, they have a word for everything. 

They didn‚Äôt stand idly by. They beginning to learn the surroundings and by 6,500 BC began farming. They also raised cattle, goats, and sheep. Water buffalo were used to pull carts. Guys, now that we have food, let‚Äôs created something to store it in. By 5,500 BC they intended and widely used pottery. Well done people.

HuH2j154cgI,The Criminal History of Lil Pump,"Lil Pump became one of the biggest names in Hip Hop within the last year or so. Pump‚Äôs repetitive and catchy songs will either have you asking yourself ‚ÄúWhat happened to Hip Hop‚Äù or turning up like no tomorrow. Regardless, you can‚Äôt deny that Lil Pump has had an impressive hip hop career especially for only being in the game for a couple of years. At only 18 years old, Lil Pump has managed to become a multi platinum recording artist and also managed to land himself a $8 million dollar record deal at Warner Brothers. But with all that money and power at such a young age, you're bound to get yourself into some sticky situations. Curious on what kind of trouble Lil Pump has gotten into? Well then look no further.

UPp3tuq6QiI,Alternate History of Europe (Le destin de l&#39;Europe) |Episode Four|,"This is a continuation (aka Season 2) of AHoE. 
If you are new, watch this first: https://youtu.be/Ex6qCLRKhCw?t=3624

This series is starting at the beginning of the 20th century. Of course, most of the events you will see will be made by my imagination. I'll try to make this mapping series as much realistic as I can, but there will be some things which will be made up and maybe sometimes unlikely to happen, to make a story line and the series much better (I hope). There may be some mistakes in the editing/grammar mistakes/typos, so please be reasonable. Don't take this video seriously, because it's made just for fun.

What is mapping actually?

Mapping is the creation of maps, a graphic symbolic representation of the significant features of a part of the surface of the Earth. With a random scenarios, stories, the creator is able to make a future or the history (depends of the series) using his/her imagination.

zKLH-N_X5j4,The Worst Punishments For Women In History That You Can&#39;t Believe,"‚ùÄ ‚ô° ‚ô™    Instead of punishing with death, ancient and modern nations have created many forms of cruel torture exclusively for women ...
10 most terrifying tortures in history
Boiling public opinion: 6-year-old baby tortured by her mother and mistress like an enemy
Horror: Tortured and burned because of suspected witch
""Rustic"" - Sitting wooden horse

When convicted of adultery, the woman was stripped of all her clothes and tied to a torture device with a saddle / donkey shape, in the middle there was a rough round wooden stick similar to the penis attached to the wheel shaft to move, some even get nailed around.


The wooden penis will be plugged into the vagina, when the horse runs, it will bump up on the vulva, causing the offender to bleed and suffer, and the victim will scream miserably.

Most people who are tortured in this form cannot escape death, and if they do, they will be disabled for life.

Hand clamps

This penalty was applied in Chinese feudal dynasties, which lasted until the end of Qing dynasty (19th century). This is also the most popular torture instrument for women during this period.

The woman suspected of adultery will have to put her fingers into a specialized tool for torture. This device will squeeze the victim's fingertip.

If it is too painful, the victim will faint, the cold water will be flushed to the province to continue suffering.

In addition, this form also appeared in Middle Eastern European countries with a device called ""hand grip"".

They are designed in all sizes to crush every part of the female body, from the hands, feet to the knees, even the head of the offender.

D7c7rxNUgnY,The Criminal History of Chief Keef,"Chief Keef is one of the most iconic rappers in Hip Hop history. At only 15 years old, the south side Chicago rapper took the rap game by storm after being one of the first people to really put Chicago drill music on the map. Chief Keef‚Äôs demonic style of hip hop was like nothing we‚Äôve ever seen before and had everyone from the streets all the way to the suburbs anxiously waiting for the next Chief Keef record to be released. But it wasn‚Äôt just the sound of the music that created all this hype around Chief Keef and the Chicago drill scene, it was rather the actual lyrics he was saying in his music. It was all authentic. Nobody even questioned it for a second. All it took was 30 seconds of a Chief Keef song and music video to figure out that Sosa was about that life. Whether he did the dirt himself or was around people who did, everyone knew that there wasn‚Äôt any lies being told in his music‚Ä¶ and Keef  and his affiliates have the rap sheet to prove it. Here is an exclusive inside look at the Criminal History of Chief Keef.

Kate visits their HQ in Sydney to investigate the sophisticated rapid response system designed to kick into action the second a fire is reported, while Simon joins a crew racing to stamp out a grass fire threatening a nearby town and joins a team trekking through remote bushland to extinguish spot fires started by lightning.

In this first programme of two, Simon and Kate explore why wildfires in Australia are so frequent and hard to control, unlocking the surprising secrets of fire behaviour with leading scientists working to help those on the frontline.

We believe these videos are fair use because: 

They are transformative in a positive sense, we take clips from various sources to help create an atmospheric feeling that will help people in hard situations in their life.

*If you‚Äôre new to my music project: I‚Äôm Michael a music creator (I compose, play, record, create music) and I started uploading here on YouTube back in 2011. 

I believe music can be much more than just pure entertainment. It can be a beautiful soundtrack that accompanies us through a moment, through the day or through life. My goal and journey is to create the most beautiful music possible - one track at a time. To end up with a smooth, light and precious soundtrack for you.

Many use my creations as background music while doing mental or creative work, as music for studying, doing homework, as relaxing music, spa, bar, lounge, cafe music, as music for yoga, while meditating or simply to fill their space with calm and positive soundtrack.

My music is not as much about a genre as it is about a feeling. A way of life. With my music, I try to take a little heat and speed from our generally too busy lives. A soundtrack for you, when you feel the need for some calm and positive, cooling and liberating tunes.

Thank you for listening, liking and loving, sharing and commenting! Thank you for following and supporting my music project!

qycqF1CWcXg,Background Music Instrumentals - relaxdaily - B-Sides N¬∞1,"Relaxing instrumental background music: soft, slow and relaxing music for work, to focus, study, or just to relax. Use it as music while you're studying, reading, writing, while being creative or coding, day-dreaming, reviewing, or making future plans. This music mix, B-Sides N¬∞1, is a collection of 32 tracks that I created (composed and recorded) during the first 6 months of this relaxdaily project. 

Have a wonderful day!

*I‚Äôm Michael and I love creating music. I play, compose and record mostly calm and peaceful tunes and started sharing these here on YouTube in 2011. 

Music can be much more than just pure entertainment. It can be a meaningful soundtrack that accompanies us through a moment, through a day, a phase, or through life. 
 
Many use my recordings and piano music sessions as background music while reading, doing mind work, to achieve better focus, while studying, while being creative, while coding or designing a product, a service or the world of tomorrow. From your comments I know that my music also works as relaxing music, spa or yoga music, or to set a calm tone at cafes, bars, lounges, in hotels and restaurants, mostly at a low volume.

This project is not as much about a genre as it is about a feeling. A way of life. With my tunes, I try to take a little heat and speed from our generally quite busy lives. A soundtrack for you, when you feel the need for a calm and peaceful, light and positive tune, the relaxdaily way.

Thank you for tuning in, for liking, sharing and commenting! Thank you for following and supporting what I do! 

 - Michael a.k.a. relaxdaily

""India is special and its beauty absolutely humbled me. When we toured there as Major Lazer, it was mind blowing to see our fan-base and we wanted to incorporate the attitude and positive vibes into our video and just do something that embodies the essence of Major Lazer. Major Lazer has always been a culture mashup and to us, India feels like some kind of special creature with one foot in history and one firmly in the future. The experience is something we'll never forget.""

Lyrics:
[Intro: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Oh, oh-oh
Oh

[Chorus: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
(Kio, Kio)

[Verse 1: Lil Nas X]
I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now

[Refrain: Lil Nas X]
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[Verse 2: Lil Nas X]
Ridin' on a tractor
Lean all in my bladder
Cheated on my baby
You can go and ask her
My life is a movie
Bull ridin' and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty

[Refrain: Lil Nas X]
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

[Verse 3: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more

[Chorus: Lil Nas X & Billy Ray Cyrus]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

Lyrics:

Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else
Gets me frustrated
Life's like this
You, you fall and you crawl and you break
And you take what you get and you turn it into honesty
You promised me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no
